        <p>
          I'm a programming student with a passion for learning and problem
          solving. My education is focused on Java development and so far I have
          developed GUI based applications in Java with a focus on object
          oriented programming and some lambda etc, managed MySQL databases and
          more. Currently we are studying some front end development. Beyond my
          formal education I have learned a number of things as well, including
          a bit of PHP and Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have an educational background within business studies and while I
          have a business degree and I find that interesting as well, I've
          discovered that programming is my true passion. I'm a very analytical,
          logical minded and also creative. I feel like I need to express myself
          within those areas and programming is a perfect fit. There is
          something quite satisfying about solving new and interesting problems
          in a logical manner while refining the process and discovering new
          ways to do things over time.
        </p>
        <p>It's like a puzzle game to me and it
          makes me excited to keep learning and growing as a developer. While my
          education is focused on the back end, I am working towards at least a
          fundamental understanding of full stack development. I feel like I've
          come pretty far as a student, but this is only the beginning and I'm
          excited for what the future holds.</p>
