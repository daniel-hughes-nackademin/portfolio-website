          <h2>Webshop Simulation</h2>
          <p>
            A project that shows a webshop style GUI and interacts with a MySQL
            database using special procedures to place orders and do other
            operations while modeling the table entities and using the data in
            java. -

          <h2>Black Jack Game</h2>
          <p>
            A simple Black Jack game that shows faces for the player and dealer
            with reactions to different outcomes. Number of decks and rounds can
            be set via sliders which saves to properties file. Number of games
            won or lost are also tracked. The code is written with MVC in mind
            and implements subject-observer interface. -

          <h2>Picture Tile Game</h2>
          <p>
            A tile game built in Java Swing with options for playing a picture
            game or a numbers game. The game can be played normally or with a
            time limit. The game is multi-threaded featuring advertisement
            images and facial expressions that get more desperate if you run low
            on time. These features can be toggled on or off. It's also possible
            to import custom pictures to play with. -

          <h2>Group Project Banking Simulation</h2>
          <p>
            In this group project we built two CRUD applications connected to a
            MySQL database; one for admin and one for customers. In the admin
            program CRUD operations are possible for most attributes. Once
            customers log in they can make withdrawals but have limited access. -
